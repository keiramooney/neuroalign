# LLM NeuroAlign

This repo contains my summer project investigating neural alignment techniques between human brain activity and LLM representations.

## Goals
- Explore shared structure between LLM activations and human neural signals.
- Use datasets like fMRI or MEG to analyze representational similarity.
- Test alignment across tasks (e.g., language comprehension, narrative recall).
- Build models that predict or map between neural and LLM spaces.

## Structure
- `data/` 
- `models/` 
- `eval/` 
- `notebooks/` 
- `logs/` 

## Note
This work is exploratory and may be extended into multimodal LLM alignment research.
